# Adding Trust

AI Catalog separates contributor claims from signatures. An entry can carry optional `trustManifests` keyed by contributor identity, while its `signatures` array records endorsements of selected fields. Neither is needed for a minimal catalog.

## Choosing what to publish

Add a digest when consumers need to check the artifact's content. Add a Trust Manifest when a contributor has attestations, provenance, or a trust-framework declaration to share. Add a signature to authenticate selected entry fields and bind them to that artifact release.

A minimal catalog needs only entries. Discoverable catalogs add Host Info and the well-known discovery location. Trusted catalogs additionally satisfy the specification's publisher-signature and evidence requirements; the presence of an arbitrary signature does not establish that conformance level.

## Trust Manifest structure

`entry.trustManifests` is a map whose keys are identity URIs. Each value contains that contributor's trust metadata:

```json
{
  "trustManifests": {
    "did:web:acme-corp.com": {
      "provenance": [
        {
          "relation": "publishedFrom",
          "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme-corp/finance-agent"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This is an excerpt, not a complete entry. An identity key is a claim about the contributor, not proof that the contributor supplied the metadata. Authenticate it through a signature that covers the manifest and whose verified signer matches the key.

| Manifest field | Description |
|---|---|
| `trustSchema` | Identifies an external trust framework and its version |
| `attestations` | Array of compliance and identity evidence references |
| `provenance` | Array of lineage links |
| `extensions` | Namespaced custom trust metadata |

A manifest must include a trust schema or a non-empty attestations array, provenance array, or extensions map. Artifact `digest`, `privacyPolicyUrl`, and `termsOfServiceUrl` belong directly on the entry. Signing times and the detached JWS belong to each signature object.

A `trustSchema` names a trust framework; it does not by itself prove compliance or supply an executable verification policy. Consumers need to understand the referenced framework before using it in a trust decision.

!!! tip "Attestation document format"
    Evidence may be human-readable, such as a PDF audit report, or machine-readable, such as a signed credential. Verification depends on that evidence's format and the consumer's policy.

## Adding compliance attestations

For regulated environments, add compliance evidence:

```json
"attestations": [
  {
    "type": "SOC2-Type2",
    "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
    "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    "description": "SOC 2 Type 2 report, valid through 2026"
  },
  {
    "type": "ISO27701",
    "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/credentials/iso27701.sd-jwt",
    "digest": "sha256:abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    "description": "ISO/IEC 27701 privacy management certification (IETF SD-JWT VC) issued by did:web:auditor.example"
  },
  {
    "type": "ISO27001",
    "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/certs/iso27001.pdf"
  }
]
```

The `digest` field allows clients to verify the attestation document hasn't been tampered with after being referenced in the catalog.

!!! tip "Attestation freshness"
    Attestations have no built-in expiry. Include a `description` with the validity period, and update the catalog entry's `updatedAt` field when you refresh attestations. Alternatively, you can rely on expiry mechanisms defined by the attestation document format (e.g., Verifiable Credential validity).

## Adding provenance

Provenance links trace where an artifact came from:

```json
"provenance": [
  {
    "relation": "publishedFrom",
    "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme-corp/finance-agent",
    "sourceDigest": "sha256:fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321"
  }
]
```

The `relation` field is an open string. Three common values:

| Relation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `publishedFrom` | The artifact was built from this source repository |
| `derivedFrom` | The artifact was derived from another artifact |
| `materializedFrom` | The artifact was materialized from an OCI registry |

`sourceId` is a URI identifying the source. `sourceDigest` is a cryptographic hash (`sha256:...`) for integrity verification.

## Signing an entry

Each object in `entry.signatures` contains `paths`, `issuedAt`, optional `expiresAt`, and `jws`. Paths are arrays of object keys relative to the entry. Arrays of values, such as attestations, are selected whole; paths do not traverse array elements. Each path element is the exact object key; for example, `["extensions", "https://example.com/metadata"]` selects one entry extension.

A typical contributor signature selects the entire manifest plus the artifact-binding fields:

```json
{
  "paths": [
    ["identifier"],
    ["type"],
    ["digest"],
    ["trustManifests", "did:web:acme-corp.com"]
  ],
  "issuedAt": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z",
  "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDp3ZWI6YWNtZS1jb3JwLmNvbSNyZWxlYXNlLXNpZ25pbmcta2V5In0..detached-jws-signature"
}
```

The JWS here is an illustrative placeholder. If the entry declares `version`, include `["version"]` in that same signature. Include policy links or other fields when they are also part of the endorsement.

The signer resolves each path, sorts the resulting path/value pairs using the specification's ordering rule, and constructs the payload with the signature context and timestamps. JCS (RFC 8785) canonicalizes that payload before JWS signing. The detached JWS stores no second copy of the values. Follow the full specification for the exact payload and verification algorithm.

Signing one contributor's manifest permits another contributor to add a separate manifest and signature without invalidating the first signature. Changing a value selected by the first signature invalidates it. Selecting an entire map or array also covers its membership and all nested values.

## Authenticating the signer

The protected JWS header carries `alg` and `kid`. The interoperable profile uses `ES256` and an absolute key reference such as `did:web:acme-corp.com#release-signing-key`.

The verifier retrieves the root DID document from `https://acme-corp.com/.well-known/did.json` and checks that the selected P-256 key is authorized through `assertionMethod`. A key listed only for authentication or key agreement does not satisfy this profile.

This authenticates a signer. Publisher authority is a separate check: for the interoperable publisher profile, the root `did:web` domain must match the publisher domain of the entry's standard `urn:air` identifier. An independent contributor may authenticate with its own DID without thereby becoming the artifact's publisher.

Consumers should:

1. Check path validity and required field coverage, including `identifier`, `type`, `digest`, and any declared `version` together for artifact binding.
2. Reconstruct and canonicalize the payload, including its context and timestamps.
3. Resolve the protected `kid`, check assertion authorization, and verify the ES256 JWS.
4. Check freshness and the authority needed for the intended endorsement; check the contributor identity key when accepting a manifest as that contributor's claims.
5. Verify the artifact bytes against the signed entry digest, and evaluate referenced evidence according to its format and local policy.

If a check fails, do not treat the affected claims as verified. Consumers can retain an unverified entry, retry temporary resolution failures, or reject it according to local policy. A valid signature proves an endorsement, not that the artifact is safe or every claim is true.

## Host and catalog signatures

Host Info and the catalog root can also carry `signatures`. Their paths resolve relative to those objects, using the same signature format. Host Info has no Trust Manifest member.

A catalog signature covering the entire `entries` array includes all nested entry signatures. Adding a nested signature therefore changes that selected value. A root signature over only selected fields does not authenticate an entire catalog snapshot; use the coverage requirements in the specification for that purpose.

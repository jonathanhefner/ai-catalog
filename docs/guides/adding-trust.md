# Adding Trust

The Trust Manifest is an optional extension to AI Catalog entries that enables verifiable identity, compliance attestations, and provenance tracking. You don't need it to publish a catalog — but it's valuable for regulated environments, enterprise deployments, and public registries.

## When do you need trust?

| Use case | Level needed |
|---|---|
| Internal tooling, quick prototyping | No trust metadata needed |
| Public tools, developer marketplace | Consider publisher identity |
| Enterprise deployments, compliance-sensitive | Attestations (SOC2, ISO, HIPAA) |
| High-assurance environments | Signed Trust Manifests + provenance |

## Conformance levels

Trust builds on the three conformance levels:

=== "Level 1 — Minimal"

    Just entries with types and URLs. No host, no trust metadata.

    ```json
    {
      "specVersion": "1.0",
      "entries": [...]
    }
    ```

=== "Level 2 — Discoverable"

    Adds a `host` object and is served at `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`.

    ```json
    {
      "specVersion": "1.0",
      "host": {
        "displayName": "Acme Corp",
        "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com"
      },
      "entries": [...]
    }
    ```

=== "Level 3 — Trusted"

    Adds signed, subject-bound Trust Manifests with verifiable identity, attestations, and provenance.

    ```json
    {
      "specVersion": "1.0",
      "host": { ... },
      "entries": [
        {
          "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:a2a:finance",
          "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
          "url": "...",
          "trustManifest": {
            "identity": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
            "subject": {
              "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:a2a:finance",
              "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
              "digest": "sha256:9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08"
            },
            "issuedAt": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z",
            "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDp3ZWI6YWNtZS1jb3JwLmNvbSNyZWxlYXNlLXNpZ25pbmcta2V5In0..detached-jws-signature"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Trust Manifest structure

A Trust Manifest is an object on a Catalog Entry (or Host Info object). It always requires `identity` and must contain substantive trust evidence. A signed Trust Manifest also requires `subject` and `issuedAt`.

| Field | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `attestations` | Optional | Array of compliance and identity attestation objects |
| `expiresAt` | Optional | Time after which a signed Trust Manifest is stale |
| `extensions` | Optional | Open map for custom trust metadata |
| `identity` | Required | Globally unique URI identifying the issuer to which the Trust Manifest's claims are attributed |
| `identityType` | Optional | Descriptive type hint for the identity URI; consumers determine the mechanism from `identity` itself |
| `issuedAt` | Required when signed | Time at which a signed Trust Manifest was issued |
| `privacyPolicyUrl` | Optional | URL to the privacy policy |
| `provenance` | Optional | Array of provenance links (source code, OCI digests) |
| `signature` | Required at Level 3 | Detached JWS signature over the Trust Manifest content |
| `subject` | Required when signed | Logical artifact release and exact representation covered by a signature |
| `termsOfServiceUrl` | Optional | URL to the terms of service |
| `trustSchema` | Optional | Describes the trust framework applied |

!!! tip "Attestation document format"
    Attestation documents are not restricted to any particular format — they can be human-readable (e.g., a PDF audit report) or machine-readable for automated verification (e.g., JWTs, Verifiable Credentials).

## Identifying the issuer

`trustManifest.identity` identifies the party to which the Trust Manifest's
claims are attributed. It does not identify the artifact or a running workload.
The artifact release is identified by the signed `subject`; runtime identity is
defined by the artifact's protocol or a separate runtime-security profile.

For a signed Entry Trust Manifest, AI Catalog defines one interoperable issuer
profile. The entry uses a standard `urn:air` identifier and the issuer uses the
root `did:web` DID for the identifier's publisher domain:

The following excerpt shows only that relationship; a complete Catalog Entry
and substantive Trust Manifest require the additional fields shown elsewhere
in this guide.

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:a2a:finance",
  "trustManifest": {
    "identity": "did:web:acme-corp.com"
  }
}
```

This relationship allows a verifier to authenticate control of the
`acme-corp.com` publisher namespace through the domain's DID document. It does
not establish that Acme is reputable, that every claim is accurate, or that the
artifact is safe. Those decisions remain consumer or registry policy.

The optional `publisher` object provides human-readable metadata and is outside
the Trust Manifest signature. A `publisher-identity` attestation can bind that
metadata to an issuer when the attestation format defines the necessary claims
and verification procedure. The type string alone does not provide that proof.

## Adding compliance attestations

For regulated environments, add compliance evidence:

```json
"attestations": [
  {
    "type": "SOC2-Type2",
    "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
    "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    "description": "SOC 2 Type 2 report, valid through 2026"
  },
  {
    "type": "ISO27701",
    "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/credentials/iso27701.sd-jwt",
    "digest": "sha256:abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    "description": "ISO/IEC 27701 privacy management certification (IETF SD-JWT VC) issued by did:web:auditor.example"
  },
  {
    "type": "ISO27001",
    "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/certs/iso27001.pdf"
  }
]
```

The `digest` field allows clients to verify the attestation document hasn't been tampered with after being referenced in the catalog.

!!! tip "Attestation freshness"
    Attestations have no built-in expiry. Include a `description` with the validity period, and update the catalog entry's `updatedAt` field when you refresh attestations. Alternatively, you can rely on expiry mechanisms defined by the attestation document format (e.g., Verifiable Credential validity).

## Adding provenance

Provenance links trace where an artifact came from:

```json
"provenance": [
  {
    "relation": "publishedFrom",
    "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme-corp/finance-agent",
    "sourceDigest": "sha256:fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321"
  }
]
```

The `relation` field is an open string. Three common values:

| Relation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `publishedFrom` | The artifact was built from this source repository |
| `derivedFrom` | The artifact was derived from another artifact |
| `materializedFrom` | The artifact was materialized from an OCI registry |

`sourceId` is a URI identifying the source. `sourceDigest` is a cryptographic hash (`sha256:...`) for integrity verification.

## Signing the Trust Manifest

A signature turns the Trust Manifest from advisory metadata into tamper-evident assertions. Without a signature, an attacker who can modify the catalog can also substitute the Trust Manifest with forged claims.

The `signature` field holds a detached JWS (RFC 7515):

```json
"trustManifest": {
  "identity": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
  "attestations": [...],
  "subject": {
    "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:a2a:finance",
    "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
    "digest": "sha256:9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08"
  },
  "issuedAt": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z",
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDp3ZWI6YWNtZS1jb3JwLmNvbSNyZWxlYXNlLXNpZ25pbmcta2V5In0..detached-jws-signature"
}
```

The signature is computed over the Trust Manifest content using JCS (RFC 8785)
canonicalization. The stored value is a detached compact JWS with a protected
`alg` header of `ES256` and an absolute DID URL in `kid`, such as
`did:web:acme-corp.com#release-signing-key`.

The verifier retrieves the current DID document from
`https://acme-corp.com/.well-known/did.json`. The key selected by `kid` must be
an ES256 P-256 JWK authorized by the DID document's `assertionMethod`
relationship. A key listed only for authentication or key agreement cannot sign
an AI Catalog Trust Manifest.

Clients verifying signatures should:

1. Extract the `signature` field and remove it from the object
2. Canonicalize the remaining Trust Manifest using JCS
3. Confirm the signed `urn:air` publisher domain exactly matches the root
   `did:web` identity
4. Resolve the DID document and select the `kid` verification method authorized
   by `assertionMethod`
5. Verify the ES256 JWS signature
6. Confirm `subject.identifier` and `subject.type` match the Catalog Entry; when
   the entry has a `version`, confirm `subject.version` is present and matches;
   when `subject.url` is present, confirm it matches the entry URL
7. Verify the artifact content against `subject.digest`

If any step does not succeed, clients must not treat the Trust Manifest's
claims as verified. They may still retain or display the Catalog Entry as
unverified, retry a temporarily unavailable DID resolution, or reject the
entry according to local policy.

## Trust layers

Trust is progressive — use the layer appropriate to your threat model:

| Layer | What it provides | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — TLS** | Prevents eavesdropping and casual tampering | HTTPS certificate chain |
| **1 — Provenance digests** | Detects artifact tampering in transit | Hash the fetched artifact, compare to `sourceDigest` |
| **2 — Signed Trust Manifest** | Binds signed claims to an artifact release | Verify the JWS and confirm that the signed subject matches the entry and artifact |
| **3 — OCI content-addressing** | Makes modification structurally impossible | All content addressed by digest in an OCI registry |

For most use cases, Layer 0 (HTTPS) + Layer 2 (signed Trust Manifest) provides a strong baseline.

# Mapping to Distribution Substrates

The AI Catalog specification defines a **logical format**: a JSON
document with `entries`, `displayName`, `type`, and `trustManifests`
fields that are immediately meaningful to anyone working with AI
artifacts. Authors write simple JSON. APIs serve simple JSON. Clients
consume simple JSON.

That logical format can be **physically distributed** over more than one
substrate — an OCI registry, an [[xRegistry]] registry, or a plain HTTP
server. Each substrate has its own data model and its own native
capabilities. To keep the logical format authoritative and to avoid
diverging, substrate-specific dialects, every binding defined by this
specification MUST satisfy the same contract: packing a logical document
into the substrate and unpacking it again MUST reproduce an equivalent
logical document.

```
Authoring                      Distribution                    Consumption
─────────                      ────────────                    ───────────
ai-catalog.json   ──pack──►   OCI / xRegistry / HTTP  ──unpack──►   ai-catalog.json
  entries[]                     substrate-native form                entries[]
  trustManifests                                                      trustManifests
```

This separation keeps authoring and consumption simple: publishers and
clients work with domain vocabulary (`entries`, `displayName`,
`type`, `trustManifests`), while infrastructure that wants
content-addressing, signing, replication, or registry APIs uses whichever
binding below matches its substrate.

## Binding Invariants

A conforming binding MUST preserve each of the following invariants. This
list — not any single substrate's vocabulary — is the conformance bar for
a pack/unpack round-trip.

| Logical concept | Invariant a binding MUST preserve |
|:---|:---|
| Entry identity (`identifier`) | A stable, addressable identity for each entry |
| Artifact content + `type` | The artifact bytes are retrievable together with their media type |
| Catalog structure / nesting | Nested catalogs remain navigable as a hierarchy |
| Trust Manifest association | An entry's Trust Manifests and their contributor identity keys are recoverable |
| Content integrity | The served bytes are verifiably bound to `entry.digest` |
| Signing | Selected fields, signer identity, and signature timestamps remain verifiable |

## Delegate, Don't Duplicate

Substrates differ in what they can express natively. OCI is
content-addressed and has first-class signing (Cosign/Notation);
xRegistry is a hierarchical resource API with versioning and
cross-referencing but no native digest or signature primitive.

A binding can **delegate** an invariant when a native primitive supplies
the same guarantee, and otherwise **carries** the logical data needed to
preserve it. The existence of native signing does not make its signer or
covered claims equivalent to a logical AI Catalog endorsement. A binding
MUST NOT drop a guarantee the substrate cannot reproduce.

| Invariant | OCI primitive (delegate) | xRegistry primitive (delegate) | Carried fallback |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Identity | Repository path + digest | `resourceid` / `xid` | `entry.identifier` |
| Content + media type | `layers[0]` + `artifactType` | Resource document + `contenttype` | Entry artifact + `type` |
| Nesting | Nested Image Index | Nested Group / `xref` | Nested entry |
| Manifest association | Referrers API (`subject`) | `xref` / extension attribute | Inline `trustManifests` |
| Content integrity | Content-addressed digest | *(none — carried)* | `entry.digest` |
| Signing | Cosign / Notation referrer for native OCI endorsements | *(none — carried)* | Entry `signatures` |

Native substrate signatures do not automatically reproduce a contributor's
logical signature. To preserve existing AI Catalog signatures, retain their
objects and every selected value so that the same payload can be reconstructed.
This applies to entry, host, and catalog signatures. Preserve original array
order and optional-member presence where covered; store additional logical
metadata when the substrate cannot reconstruct it. In particular, a complete
catalog snapshot signature requires the original entries array, including
nested signatures, rather than a newly ordered listing of registry resources.

The [OCI Distribution](oci-distribution.md) and [xRegistry](xregistry.md)
mappings are concrete bindings of this contract. The OCI binding delegates
identity and content integrity and adds native signing; the xRegistry binding
delegates structure, identity, and discovery but carries content integrity
and signing because xRegistry has no native primitive for them.

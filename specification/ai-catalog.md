# Introduction

The AI ecosystem comprises a growing number of protocols, artifact
formats, and service types. Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers,
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) agents, Claude Code plugins, datasets, model cards,
and other AI artifacts each define their own metadata and discovery
mechanisms. This fragmentation forces clients and registries to
implement bespoke logic for each artifact type, increasing complexity
and reducing interoperability.

This document defines the **AI Catalog**: a typed, nestable JSON
container for discovering heterogeneous AI artifacts. Each entry
declares its artifact type via a media type and may reference or
embed the native artifact metadata. A minimal catalog is simply a
list of entries — names, types, and URLs — requiring no additional
infrastructure.

For environments that need verifiable identity, compliance evidence,
or provenance tracking, this document also defines an optional **Trust
Manifest** object. An entry can carry independent Trust Manifests keyed
by contributor identity, containing attestations and provenance without
wrapping or modifying the artifact's native format. Optional signatures
on entries, Host Info, and catalogs authenticate selected fields.
Implementations that do not need trust metadata can ignore these features.

The AI Catalog is intentionally agnostic about the artifacts it
indexes. It does not define or constrain the schema of MCP server
manifests, A2A agent cards, or any other artifact format. Instead, it
relies on media types to identify what each entry is, and delegates
the definition of artifact-specific metadata to the respective protocol
specifications.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

The following terms are used throughout this document:

AI Catalog
: A JSON document conforming to the `application/ai-catalog+json`
  media type that contains an ordered list of catalog entries.

Catalog Entry
: A single item in an AI Catalog, identified by a media type and
  referencing or embedding an AI artifact.

Trust Manifest
: A JSON object grouping one contributor's trust metadata about an AI
  artifact. Its identity key attributes the claims; a verified signature
  authenticates an endorsement of the selected claims.

Artifact
: Any AI resource described by a catalog entry, such as an MCP server
  manifest, an A2A agent card, a Claude Code plugin, a
  dataset descriptor, or a nested AI Catalog.

# Design Goals

1. **Artifact Agnosticism**: The catalog MUST be capable of indexing
   any type of AI artifact without requiring knowledge of the
   artifact's internal schema.

2. **Media Type Identification**: Each catalog entry MUST declare its
   artifact type using a media type, enabling clients to select,
   filter, and route entries without parsing artifact content.

3. **Composability**: The catalog format supports nesting — a catalog
   entry can reference another AI Catalog, enabling hierarchical
   organization and multi-artifact packaging.

4. **Progressive Complexity**: The simplest catalog is just entries
   with names and URLs. Trust, identity, and provenance metadata are
   available as optional extensions that never modify the catalog
   structure or artifact formats.

5. **Scalable Federation**: The catalog format enables partitioning
   into sub-catalogs to manage size, and supports delegation to
   sub-catalogs managed by independent publishers. Nested catalog
   entries support a federated model where each segment of the
   hierarchy may be authored, hosted, and updated independently.

6. **Location Independence**: An AI Catalog MAY be served from any URL.
   The standard defines a well-known URL convention to enable
   automated discovery, but catalogs are equally valid when hosted at
   arbitrary paths, embedded in registries, or distributed as files.

# AI Catalog

## Media Type

An AI Catalog document is identified by the media type:

    application/ai-catalog+json

## Top-Level Structure

An AI Catalog document is a JSON object that MUST contain the following
members:

`specVersion`
: A string indicating the version of this specification that the
  catalog conforms to, in "Major.Minor" format (e.g., "1.0").
  See [Version Handling](#version-handling) for compatibility rules.

`entries`
: An array of Catalog Entry objects as defined in [Catalog Entry](#catalog-entry).
  This array MAY be empty.

For example, a minimal catalog listing four AI artifacts:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:skill:code-review",
      "displayName": "Code Review Assistant",
      "type": "application/agent-skills+zip",
      "url": "https://skills.example.com/code-review/skill.zip"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:mcp:weather",
      "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp/server-card"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:a2a:research",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://agents.example.com/researchAssistant"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:agent:productivity-plugin",
      "displayName": "Productivity Plugin",
      "type": "application/agent-plugins+zip",
      "description": "Tools for common productivity workflows.",
      "tags": ["productivity", "workflows"],
      "url": "https://plugins.example.com/productivity.zip"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`host`
: A Host Info object as defined in [Host Info](#host-info) identifying the
  operator of this catalog.

`extensions`
: A JSON object (map) containing custom, vendor-specific, or
  non-standard fields. See [Extensions](#extensions) for definitions and
  official extension types.

`signatures`
: An array of [Signature objects](#signature-object), each authenticating
  selected fields of this catalog. A selected-field signature provides
  complete snapshot integrity only when it satisfies
  [Catalog Snapshot Coverage](#catalog-snapshot-coverage). Signer
  authentication alone does not establish authority to represent the
  catalog operator; see [Host and Catalog Authorization](#host-and-catalog-authorization).

## Host Info

The Host Info object identifies the operator of the catalog. It MUST
contain:

`displayName`
: A string containing the human-readable name of the host (e.g., the
  organization name).

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`identifier`
: A string containing a verifiable identifier for the host (e.g., a
  DID or domain name).

`documentationUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the host's documentation.

`logoUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the host's logo.

`signatures`
: An array of [Signature objects](#signature-object) authenticating selected
  fields of this Host Info object. No Trust Manifest wrapper is required.
  See [Host and Catalog Authorization](#host-and-catalog-authorization).

For example:

```json
{
  "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
  "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
  "documentationUrl": "https://docs.acme-corp.com/ai",
  "logoUrl": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0c..."
}
```

## Catalog Entry

A Catalog Entry object describes a single AI artifact in the catalog.
It MUST contain the following members:

`identifier`
: A string uniquely identifying this artifact. This field is an open text format (e.g., any valid URI or URN is accepted). However, to ensure interoperability, identity uniqueness, and discoverability, the standard `urn:air` naming structure is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** and **MUST** be used for open or federated systems.

    **Standard Naming Format:**
    `urn:air:{publisher}:{namespace}:{name}`

    - `{publisher}`: The domain name of the organization publishing the artifact (e.g., `example.com`).
    - `{namespace}`: The logical namespace, which can contain one or more colon-separated categories (e.g., `mcp`, `skill`, `agent`, `finance:agent`).
    - `{name}`: The stable, unique name of the artifact within the publisher's namespace.

    *Examples:*

    - `urn:air:example.com:skill:code-review`
    - `urn:air:example.com:mcp:weather`

    For closed or local systems where a different identifier format is used, client implementations are responsible for parsing and processing the custom format as appropriate.

    See [Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries) for uniqueness rules when multiple versions are present.

`type`
: A string containing the identifier that specifies the type of the
  referenced artifact. This field is an open text format, so any string value is accepted. However, to ensure interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED to use one of the following recognized "known types" in the ecosystem when applicable, partitioned by their respective governance boundaries:

    **Core Protocol Types (Governed by the AI Catalog WG):**

    - `application/ai-catalog+json` — a nested AI Catalog
    - `application/agent-card+json` — reserved for a generic Agent Card format

    **Integrated Ecosystem & Third-Party Types (Governed externally):**

    - `application/a2a-agent-card+json` — an A2A Agent Card
    - `application/mcp-server-card+json` — an MCP Server Card
    - `application/agent-skills+json` — Agent Skill Metadata json file
    - `application/agent-skills+md` — an Agent Skill defined in a standard Markdown file (the suffix `+md` is to be registered)
    - `application/agent-skills+zip` — an Agent Skill bundle (ZIP archive)
    - `application/agent-skills+gzip` — an Agent Skill bundle (gzipped tarball)
    - `application/agent-plugins+zip` — an Agent Plugin bundle (ZIP archive)
    - `application/agent-plugins+gzip` — an Agent Plugin bundle (gzipped tarball)

    These values are designed to align with official IANA media type registration standards. Standard ecosystem types use registered structured syntax suffixes (`+json`, `+zip`, `+gzip`). For any new or custom types not listed here, it is up to the specific client implementation to handle them correctly.

A Catalog Entry MUST contain exactly one of the following members to
provide the artifact content:

`url`
: A string containing a URL where the full artifact document can be
  retrieved. The document served at this URL SHOULD be served with
  the media type declared in the `type` field.

`data`
: A JSON value containing the complete artifact document inline. The
  structure of this value is determined by the `type` field and
  is opaque to this specification.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`displayName`
: A string containing a human-readable name for the artifact.
  This field SHOULD be set only when the referenced artifact does not
  already carry its own canonical human-readable name — for example a
  raw dataset (`application/parquet`), a model blob, a skill bundle
  (`application/agent-skills+zip`), or an Agent Plugin bundle
  (`application/agent-plugins+zip`), none of which directly expose a
  self-describing name without processing the artifact. When the referenced
  artifact does carry such a name — for
  example the `name` field of an A2A Agent Card or the `title` field of
  an MCP Server Card — that artifact is the authoritative source and
  `displayName` SHOULD be omitted to avoid duplicating a value that can
  drift out of sync. When `displayName` *is* present, however, it takes
  precedence: it is the authoritative value for display, and a consumer
  SHOULD render it as given even when it differs from a name carried by
  the referenced artifact. Setting `displayName` is how a publisher
  deliberately overrides the artifact's own name. See
  [Resolving an Artifact's Display Name](#resolving-an-artifact-s-display-name)
  for the full consumer resolution order.

`description`
: A string containing a short description of the artifact. Like
  `displayName`, `description` is OPTIONAL and follows the same
  authoritative-source rule: when the referenced artifact carries its
  own canonical description — for example the `description` field of an
  A2A Agent Card or an MCP Server Card — that artifact is the
  authoritative source and entry `description` SHOULD be omitted to
  avoid duplicating a value that can drift out of sync. When entry
  `description` *is* present, however, it takes precedence: a consumer
  SHOULD render it as given even when it differs from a description
  carried by the referenced artifact, which is how a publisher provides
  a listing-specific blurb. See
  [Resolving an Artifact's Description](#resolving-an-artifact-s-description)
  for the full consumer resolution order.

`tags`
: An array of strings serving as keywords for filtering and discovery.

`version`
: A string containing the version of this artifact.
  [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is RECOMMENDED but not
  required. See [Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries) for
  how versions interact with `identifier`.

    Like `displayName` and `description`, `version` can restate a value
    the referenced artifact already carries (an A2A Agent Card
    `version`, an MCP Server Card `version`), and when a single entry
    references such an artifact the entry `version` SHOULD be omitted to
    avoid drift — the consumer can read it from the artifact. An entry
    MAY include that version when it needs to be signed directly. Unlike
    `displayName` and `description`, however, `version` is not merely
    cosmetic: it is part of the entry's uniqueness key, so it is
    REQUIRED when a catalog lists multiple versions of the same
    `identifier` (see [Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries)).
    A present `version` is used for catalog-level sorting and selection
    rather than as a free-form display override, so it SHOULD equal the
    version the referenced artifact reports; an entry `version` that
    contradicts the artifact's own version is a publishing error, not a
    deliberate override. See
    [Resolving an Artifact's Version](#resolving-an-artifact-s-version)
    for the full consumer resolution order.

`updatedAt`
: A string containing an ISO 8601 [[RFC3339]] timestamp indicating
  when this entry was last modified.

`extensions`
: A JSON object (map) containing custom data.

`publisher`
: A Publisher object as defined in [Publisher Object](#publisher-object)
  identifying the entity that publishes this artifact. This is the
  sole location for publisher information; it is not duplicated in
  the Trust Manifest.

`digest`
: A string containing the artifact content digest in [Digest Format](#digest-format).
  For `url`, hash the exact retrieved artifact bytes. For `data`, hash the
  UTF-8 JCS-canonicalized [[RFC8785]] JSON value. A digest alone does not
  authenticate its source; see [Entry Release Coverage](#entry-release-coverage).

`privacyPolicyUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the privacy policy governing this artifact.

`termsOfServiceUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the terms of service governing this artifact.

`trustManifests`
: A JSON object mapping contributor identity URIs to [Trust Manifest](#trust-manifest)
  objects. Each value groups that contributor's trust metadata about this
  artifact. The key is attribution, not proof of authorship.

`signatures`
: An array of [Signature objects](#signature-object) authenticating selected
  entry fields. An entry MAY be signed without carrying a Trust Manifest.
  Signatures can cover one or more manifests, shared entry fields, or both.

### Resolving an Artifact's Display Name

Because `displayName` is OPTIONAL, a consumer rendering a catalog entry
cannot assume it is present. To obtain a human-readable name, a consumer
SHOULD resolve one in the following order:

1. **`displayName` on the entry**, if present. A publisher-supplied
   `displayName` always wins, even when it differs from a name carried by
   the referenced artifact.
2. **The referenced artifact's own canonical name**, if the consumer has
   already fetched or cached the artifact — for example the `name` field
   of an A2A Agent Card or the `title` field of an MCP Server Card.
3. **The trailing segment of the entry's `identifier`** as a last
   resort — the portion after its final `:` or `/` delimiter. For
   example, `urn:air:example.com:mcp:weather` yields `weather` and
   `urn:air:anonymous.modelcontextprotocol.io:mcp:brave-search` yields
   `brave-search`.

A consumer SHOULD NOT dereference an artifact at render time solely to
obtain a name. A registry, directory, or other service built on top of a
catalog SHOULD resolve the name once at ingestion — alongside any other
derived metadata it attaches, such as relevance scores or tags — and
cache the result, rather than fetching artifacts on the rendering path.

This order also covers a referenced MCP Server Card whose `title` is
itself absent: step 2 yields no name, so the consumer falls through to
the `identifier` segment in step 3. A publisher MAY still set
`displayName` on such an entry to provide a better name than the bare
identifier segment.

### Resolving an Artifact's Description

Because `description` is OPTIONAL, a consumer that wants to show a
description cannot assume the entry carries one. It SHOULD resolve one in
the following order:

1. **`description` on the entry**, if present. A publisher-supplied
   `description` always wins, even when it differs from a description
   carried by the referenced artifact.
2. **The referenced artifact's own canonical description**, if the
   consumer has already fetched or cached the artifact — for example the
   `description` field of an A2A Agent Card or an MCP Server Card.
3. **No description**, if neither is available. Unlike a name, a
   description has no identifier-derived fallback; a consumer SHOULD
   simply render the entry without one.

As with name resolution, a consumer SHOULD NOT dereference an artifact at
render time solely to obtain a description. A registry, directory, or
other service built on top of a catalog SHOULD resolve the description
once at ingestion and cache the result, rather than fetching artifacts on
the rendering path.

### Resolving an Artifact's Version

Because `version` is OPTIONAL on a single entry — and present only when
the entry disambiguates others that share its `identifier` (see
[Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries)) or deliberately restates
the artifact's version — a consumer cannot assume every entry carries
one. To obtain a version, a consumer SHOULD resolve one in the following
order:

1. **`version` on the entry**, if present. Unlike `displayName` and
   `description`, a present `version` is not a free-form display
   override: it is authoritative for catalog-level sorting and version
   selection. Within a multi-version listing it is REQUIRED and, combined
   with `identifier`, uniquely addresses the entry.
2. **The referenced artifact's own version**, if the consumer has already
   fetched or cached the artifact — for example the `version` field of an
   A2A Agent Card, an MCP Server Card, or an MCP Registry `server.json`.
   A single entry that omits `version` because the artifact already
   carries it is resolved here.
3. **No version**, if neither is available — the entry represents an
   unversioned artifact. A consumer that needs to order such entries
   SHOULD fall back to `updatedAt`, consistent with
   [Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries).

When both the entry and the referenced artifact carry a `version` and
they disagree, the entry `version` is authoritative for catalog-level
sorting and selection; the mismatch is a publishing error (it breaks
latest-selection) that a consumer MAY surface but SHOULD NOT resolve by
silently preferring the artifact's value.

As with name and description resolution, a consumer SHOULD NOT dereference
an artifact at render time solely to obtain a version. A registry,
directory, or other service built on top of a catalog SHOULD resolve the
version once at ingestion and cache the result, rather than fetching
artifacts on the rendering path.

## Multi-Version Entries

A catalog MAY contain multiple entries with the same `identifier` and
different `version` values, representing a version history for a
single artifact — similar to a package registry.

When `version` is present, the combination of `identifier` and `version`
MUST be unique within the catalog. When `version` is absent, `identifier`
alone MUST be unique. The `identifier` SHOULD be stable across versions
and catalog locations so that the same logical artifact can be
recognized wherever it appears.

Clients that need only the latest version SHOULD sort entries
sharing the same `identifier` by `version` (when parseable as a semantic
version) or by `updatedAt`, and select the most recent. Clients
that need a specific version SHOULD match on both `identifier` and `version`.

For example, a catalog listing two versions of the same agent:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
      "version": "2.1.0",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/finance/v2.1.json",
      "updatedAt": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/finance/v2.0.json",
      "updatedAt": "2026-01-20T08:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Both entries share the same `identifier` but have distinct `version`
values, so the combination is unique.

## Publisher Object

The Publisher object identifies the entity responsible for an artifact.
It appears on the Catalog Entry and is the canonical location for
publisher information. It MUST contain:

`identifier`
: A string containing a verifiable identifier for the publisher
  organization.

`displayName`
: A string containing the human-readable name of the publisher.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`identityType`
: A string providing a type hint for the publisher identifier (e.g.,
  "did", "dns").

# Trust Manifest

A Trust Manifest is an OPTIONAL collection of one contributor's trust metadata
about the artifact represented by an entry. The entry's `trustManifests`
object maps identity URIs to these collections. Publisher information and
artifact coordinates remain on the entry; the artifact's native format is
unchanged. Host Info and the catalog root use `signatures` directly and do not
carry Trust Manifests.

## Contributor Identity

Every key in `trustManifests` MUST be an absolute URI [[RFC3986]] identifying
the contributor to which that value's claims are attributed. The identity
identifies the contributor asserting the references or claims, not necessarily
the issuer of every referenced attestation or provenance statement. Authors
SHOULD use their existing identity URI, such as `did:web:assessor.example`.
Keys MUST be preserved exactly when forwarding signed content. Consumers
MUST NOT infer authentication from a key's spelling or mere presence.

A signature authenticated as that contributor, covering the relevant claims
and the entry release, authenticates their attribution under the applicable
verification profile. Another signer MAY endorse those same claims, but that
endorsement MUST NOT be represented as proof that the named contributor
made them. Verification is per signature and per covered claim; signing one
manifest does not authenticate other manifests or unselected fields.

[The `did:web` Signer Profile](#the-did-web-signer-profile) defines an initial
interoperable authentication mechanism. Other identity mechanisms, including
future profiles, can use the same data model. A profile MUST define key
discovery, signer authentication, and any authorization it establishes;
consumers MUST NOT treat an unsupported identity as authenticated.

## Independent Contributions and Updates

An entry contains at most one manifest per identity. Different contributors
can add their own manifests without modifying another contributor's manifest.
A signature selecting an individual manifest remains valid after unrelated
manifests are added; a signature selecting the entire `trustManifests` map
intentionally binds its membership and all values.

Authors SHOULD normally sign a whole manifest together with the entry release
fields. Its `attestations` and `provenance` remain arrays; updating a selected
array, including changing its order, requires a new signature. The same
identity MAY publish an updated manifest for the same release.

Two registries may retrieve a contributor's manifest at different times and
hold different signed versions. When choosing among updates for the same
identity and release, consumers SHOULD prefer the manifest covered in full by
that contributor's most recent acceptable signature, comparing authenticated
`issuedAt` instants. A more
recent signature by another entity does not establish a contributor update.
An issuance time is the signer's assertion, not an independently trusted
clock. Equal issuance times with different content require local selection
policy; consumers MUST NOT infer an ordering from map order. Registries SHOULD
preserve the chosen manifest and its signatures rather than merge separately
signed contents.

## Manifest Validity

A Trust Manifest MUST contain at least one of: a `trustSchema`, a non-empty
`attestations` array, a non-empty `provenance` array, or a non-empty `extensions`
object. These members express claims or evidence; their presence does not
establish verification. Empty manifests MUST be omitted. An entry with only
shared metadata or a release signature needs no manifest.

## Optional Members

`trustSchema`
: A [Trust Schema object](#trust-schema-object) describing the framework the
  contributor applies to its claims about this artifact. The descriptor does
  not itself establish a trust root or override the consumer's policy.

`attestations`
: An array of [Attestation objects](#attestation-object) carrying references
  to evidence. Their formats or applicable profiles define evidence verification.

`provenance`
: An array of [Provenance Link objects](#provenance-link-object).

`extensions`
: A JSON object containing this contributor's additional trust metadata, using
  the namespaced keys defined in [Extensions](#extensions). Entry extensions
  describe shared artifact metadata; manifest extensions express a particular
  contributor's claims. Either location can be selected by a signature.

A manifest contains no separate `identity`, `identityType`, `subject`,
`signature`, `issuedAt`, or `expiresAt` members. Identity is in the map key,
artifact coordinates and `digest` are on the entry, and signing metadata is
in each entry signature.

For example, this unsigned entry carries independent contributions:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
  "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
  "url": "https://acme.com/finance.json",
  "trustManifests": {
    "did:web:acme.com": {
      "provenance": [{
        "relation": "publishedFrom",
        "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme/finance"
      }]
    },
    "did:web:assessor.example": {
      "attestations": [{
        "type": "SOC2-Type2",
        "uri": "https://assessor.example/reports/acme.pdf"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Trust Schema Object

A Trust Schema object describes the trust framework applied to the
artifact. It MUST contain:

`identifier`
: A string identifying the trust schema.

`version`
: A string indicating the schema version.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`governanceUri`
: A string containing a URI to the governance policy document.

`verificationMethods`
: An array of strings identifying the verification methods supported
  (e.g., "did", "x509", "dns-01").

For example:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:trust:acme-enterprise-v1",
  "version": "1.0",
  "governanceUri": "https://acme-corp.com/trust/governance.pdf",
  "verificationMethods": ["did", "x509"]
}
```

## Attestation Object

An Attestation object provides verifiable proof of a claim. It MUST
contain:

`type`
: A string identifying the attestation type (e.g., "SOC2-Type2",
  "HIPAA-Audit", "ISO27001").

`uri`
: A string containing the location of the attestation document.
  This may be an HTTPS URL or an inline Data URI [[RFC2397]].

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`digest`
: A string containing a cryptographic hash for integrity verification
  (e.g., "sha256:abcd1234...").

`size`
: An unsigned integer indicating the size of the attestation in bytes.

`description`
: A string containing a human-readable label.

For example, a compliance attestation with integrity verification:

```json
{
  "type": "SOC2-Type2",
  "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2-2026.pdf",
  "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
  "size": 245760,
  "description": "SOC2 Type 2 audit report for Acme Finance Agent (2026)"
}
```

## Provenance Link Object

A Provenance Link records lineage information. It MUST contain:

`relation`
: A string describing the relationship (e.g., "materializedFrom",
  "derivedFrom", "publishedFrom").

`sourceId`
: A string identifying the source artifact or data.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`sourceDigest`
: A string containing the digest of the source.

`registryUri`
: A string containing the URI of the registry holding the source.

`statementUri`
: A string containing the URI of a provenance statement document.

`signatureRef`
: A string referencing the key used to sign the provenance statement.

For example, a provenance link recording that an artifact was built
from a specific source commit and published through an OCI registry:

```json
{
  "relation": "publishedFrom",
  "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme-corp/finance-agent",

## Verification Procedures

This section describes how consumers verify selected entry, host, and
catalog metadata and the evidence referenced by Trust Manifests. Verification is OPTIONAL — consumers
that do not need trust assurance can skip this entirely.

### Safe Fetching

Verification procedures direct consumers to fetch artifact URLs, evidence
references (`attestation.uri`, `statementUri`, and `registryUri`), and
identity-resolution endpoints derived from signing metadata. These inputs
may be attacker-controlled before authentication, so these fetches are a
server-side request forgery (SSRF) and denial-of-service surface.
Consumers performing verification MUST:

- Resolve and reject URLs targeting private, loopback, link-local, or
  cloud metadata addresses (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`,
  `169.254.0.0/16`, `fc00::/7`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`,
  `192.168.0.0/16`), and re-check the resolved address after any
  redirect.
- Restrict fetches to the `https` scheme (or inline `data:` URIs) and
  refuse to follow redirects that cross into a disallowed address range.
- Enforce a maximum response size and a request timeout. When
  `attestation.size` is present, reject responses that exceed it; in all
  cases apply a consumer-defined ceiling.
- Treat every fetched document as untrusted input.

Consumers SHOULD prefer inline `data:` attestations and Data-URI logos
to avoid leaking verification activity to third-party endpoints.

### Digest Format

Digests in this specification use the format `algorithm:hex-value`,
where `algorithm` is a hash algorithm identifier and `hex-value` is
the lowercase hexadecimal encoding of the hash output. For example:

    sha256:9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08

Producers SHOULD use SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] or stronger. Consumers
MUST reject digest values using algorithms shorter than SHA-256.

### Signature Object

The optional `signatures` array is supported on a Catalog Entry, Host Info,
and the catalog root. A Signature object MUST contain `paths`, `issuedAt`,
and `jws`, and MAY contain `expiresAt`. It MUST NOT contain other members;
future changes to this construction require a new signature format version.

`paths`
: A non-empty array of paths. Each path is a non-empty array of strings
  identifying object member names relative to the object that contains this
  `signatures` array. For example,
  `["trustManifests", "did:web:assessor.example"]` selects that whole manifest,
  and `["extensions", "https://example.com/metadata"]` selects one extension.

`issuedAt`
: An RFC 3339 [[RFC3339]] timestamp asserting when this endorsement was issued.
  The timestamp is authenticated as part of the payload.

`expiresAt`
: An OPTIONAL RFC 3339 timestamp after which this endorsement is stale.
  If present it MUST denote an instant later than `issuedAt`.

`jws`
: A detached compact JWS [[RFC7515]] over the payload below. Each signature
  has its own payload and signer; different signatures can select different
  fields. The stored form is `encodedProtectedHeader..encodedSignature`.

#### Path Resolution and Ordering

At every path segment, the current value MUST be a JSON object containing
that exact member name. Array traversal is not supported: arrays MAY be
selected as whole values, but a segment such as `"0"` only names an object
member and never an array index. Resolution MUST use actual JSON members,
not inherited properties or implementation-specific object attributes.
An empty string is a valid member name. An empty path is not permitted.

Resolution of a missing member MUST fail; a present JSON `null` is a value,
not absence. Duplicate paths and paths where one is a prefix of another MUST
be rejected. A path whose first segment is `"signatures"` MUST be rejected,
preventing selection of the containing signature array. Nested signatures
inside a selected value MUST be included unchanged; implementations MUST NOT
recursively remove signatures. For example, a root selection of `entries`
includes entry signatures and any signatures in embedded catalogs.

For each path, form the pair `[path, resolvedValue]`. Sort the pairs by path,
comparing segments lexicographically using unsigned UTF-16 code units, as
used for property ordering by JCS [[RFC8785]]. Compare the first differing
segment; a string prefix sorts before its longer string, and a path prefix
sorts before its longer path. Locale-sensitive comparison MUST NOT be used.
Sorting these pairs does not reorder arrays in selected values.

#### Signed Payload and JWS Construction

Construct this JSON object (the names and context strings are literal):

```json
{
  "context": "ai-catalog-entry-signature-v1",
  "fields": [
    [["identifier"], "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance"],
    [["type"], "application/a2a-agent-card+json"]
  ],
  "issuedAt": "2026-09-12T10:00:00Z"
}
```

This illustrates payload construction only, not sufficient release coverage.
`fields` MUST contain the sorted pairs for exactly the stored paths.
`issuedAt` and, when present, `expiresAt` MUST be copied exactly from the
Signature object; an absent `expiresAt` MUST be omitted, not replaced by
`null`. The consumer MUST derive `context` from the containing object:

| Containing object | `context` |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog Entry | `ai-catalog-entry-signature-v1` |
| Host Info | `ai-catalog-host-signature-v1` |
| Catalog root | `ai-catalog-catalog-signature-v1` |

This binds both the selected names and their values, the endorsement times,
and the object kind and signature format version. Reordering `paths` does
not affect the payload. Changing a selected name, value, or timestamp does.

Canonicalize this payload with JCS [[RFC8785]]. Its UTF-8 bytes are the JWS
payload. Use ordinary base64url-encoded JWS signing input, then omit only the
payload segment from the stored compact serialization, as specified in
Appendix F of [[RFC7515]]. Verifiers reconstruct that segment to verify the
JWS. The containing object does not need to be mutated or copied with a
signature removed. Selected data MUST satisfy JCS's I-JSON constraints;
parsers MUST reject duplicate JSON member names rather than silently discard
one. Large integers that cannot round-trip as IEEE 754 doubles SHOULD be
encoded as strings.

The protected header MUST contain `alg`. The value `none` MUST NOT be
accepted. It MUST NOT contain `b64`: the unencoded-payload option of
[[RFC7797]] is not used. All other header parameters, algorithm allowlists,
and key-selection rules are governed by the applicable signer profile and
JWS requirements, including rejection of unsupported critical parameters.
A successful cryptographic check alone establishes neither signer identity
nor authority to make the selected claims.

#### Signature Acceptance and Time

Consumers MUST validate the Signature object's structure, path rules,
payload, JWS, and signer profile before accepting an endorsement. They MUST
validate timestamp syntax and compare timestamps as instants, not strings.
Consumers MUST NOT accept an endorsement before `issuedAt` or at or after
`expiresAt`, when present. A deployment MAY allow a small, explicitly
configured clock-skew tolerance. A new signature does not cryptographically
invalidate an old one. Endorsement expiry does not replace freshness or
validity checks defined by referenced evidence formats.

An invalid, unsupported, or expired signature MUST NOT count as a verified
endorsement. Other signatures are evaluated independently; consumers MAY
apply local requirements such as a particular signer or multiple endorsers.
They MUST NOT describe an entire entry or manifest as authenticated merely
because some subset of its fields has a valid signature.

### Entry Release Coverage

Before relying on an entry signature as an endorsement of an artifact release
or of trust claims about that release, a consumer MUST require that the SAME
signature selects `["identifier"]`, `["type"]`, and `["digest"]`, and also
`["version"]` whenever the containing entry has `version`. A present version
MUST NOT be treated as endorsed unless it is selected. This check is required
even after cryptographic verification: adding an unsigned version to a
previously unversioned entry does not change selected values, but MUST make
that signature insufficient for release endorsement of the modified entry.
Removing a selected version fails path resolution. Fields from different
signatures MUST NOT be combined to meet one signature's release coverage.

The consumer MUST also verify the artifact bytes against `entry.digest`
using [Verifying Artifact Integrity](#verifying-artifact-integrity). Selecting
`url` is OPTIONAL: it additionally endorses a particular location, while
omitting it allows mirrors serving identical bytes. When a version needs to
be signed, it is stored in `entry.version`; there is no separate subject copy.

For a trust claim to be endorsed, its value MUST also be selected by that
same signature, either directly or through a selected ancestor object. A
selection of a whole manifest covers all its contents; selections of some
children do not endorse unselected siblings or the completeness of the
manifest. A signature MAY endorse multiple manifests. Attribution to each
named contributor is evaluated separately from another signer's endorsement.

### Catalog Snapshot Coverage

A catalog signature MAY select only particular fields. To accept it as
covering the complete catalog snapshot, a consumer MUST require a path
consisting of each present top-level member name except `signatures`, including
`specVersion` and the entire `entries` array and, when present, `host` and
`extensions`. No other top-level members may be omitted from this coverage.
This coverage test MUST be repeated against the current catalog, so adding
an unselected top-level field makes a previous signature insufficient for
complete-snapshot acceptance. Removing a selected member fails resolution.

Selecting `entries` binds membership, order, and nested signatures. Adding an
entry signature therefore changes a signed catalog snapshot. The root's own
`signatures` array is excluded; adding a root co-signature does not change the
snapshot. Snapshot integrity does not replace checks on referenced artifacts
or establish the authority of entry publishers.

### The `did:web` Signer Profile

This profile authenticates a signer using a root `did:web` DID and an ES256
assertion key. It can authenticate a publisher, assessor, registry, or other
contributor. Authentication does not by itself grant publisher, host, or
catalog authority. [The `did:web` Publisher Profile](#the-did-web-publisher-profile)
adds publisher namespace authorization.

The protected `kid` MUST be an absolute DID URL consisting of a root
`did:web` DID followed by a non-empty fragment, with no path or query. Its
DID portion is the candidate signer identity. The domain MUST be lowercase
ASCII, with no port, IP address, trailing root dot, or Unicode U-label;
IDNA A-labels are permitted [[DIDWEB]] [[RFC5890]] [[RFC5891]]. For example,
`did:web:assessor.example#assertion-key` identifies a key for the candidate
identity `did:web:assessor.example`. That identity is authenticated only
when all resolution, authorization, and cryptographic checks below succeed.

Other identity mechanisms, delegated controllers, path-based `did:web` DIDs,
and algorithms require separately defined profiles. Implementations MAY
support additional profiles by agreement; they MUST NOT silently apply these
rules to a different mechanism.

#### JWS Algorithm and Key Requirements

Producers conforming to the `did:web` Signer Profile MUST use ES256 as
defined by [[RFC7518]]. Consumers implementing the `did:web` Signer Profile
MUST support ES256 and MUST reject any other `alg` value when applying that
profile. A different algorithm can be introduced by a future signature
profile; an implementation-specific choice does not extend the `did:web`
Signer Profile.

The protected JWS header MUST contain `kid`, identifying the verification
method that authorizes the signature. It MUST NOT contain `jku`, `jwk`, `x5u`,
or `x5c`; a verifier applying the `did:web` Signer Profile selects key
material only through the issuer's DID document, never from a key source named
by the signature itself.

The protected `kid` value MUST be an absolute DID URL consisting of the
candidate signer identity followed by a non-empty fragment. For example:

    did:web:example.com#release-signing-key

The `kid` MUST NOT contain a path or query component. It identifies a
verification method in the issuer's DID document; it does not identify another
DID or an external key document.

#### DID Document Resolution and Key Selection

The verifier MUST resolve the candidate signer identity according to the
`did:web` method [[DIDWEB]] and process the result as a DID document according to DID Core
[[DIDCORE]]. The resolution MUST satisfy the safe-fetching requirements in
[Safe Fetching](#safe-fetching). Resolution fails under the `did:web` Signer
Profile if the DID document cannot be retrieved and validated or if its `id` is
not exactly equal to the candidate signer identity.

The verification method selected by `kid` MUST be authorized by the DID
document's `assertionMethod` verification relationship. An
`assertionMethod` entry can contain the verification method directly or can
reference a method in the top-level `verificationMethod` collection. After
resolving relative DID URLs as defined by DID Core, the verifier MUST select
exactly one verification method whose `id` exactly equals `kid`.

A key's presence in the top-level `verificationMethod` collection does not by
itself authorize the key to sign an AI Catalog endorsement. A key used only
for another relationship, such as `authentication` or `keyAgreement`, MUST NOT be accepted.
The selected verification method's `controller` MUST exactly equal the
candidate signer identity; the `did:web` Signer Profile does not support a verification method
controlled by another DID.

The selected verification method MUST contain `publicKeyJwk` [[RFC7517]]. The
JWK MUST describe a P-256 elliptic-curve public key: `kty` MUST be `EC`, `crv`
MUST be `P-256`, and `x` and `y` MUST contain valid curve coordinates. It MUST
NOT contain private key material. When present, `alg` MUST be `ES256`, `use`
MUST be `sig`, and `key_ops` MUST permit `verify`. A `kid` member inside the
JWK, if present, is not used for verification-method selection; the DID
verification method's `id` is authoritative.

#### Current-State Verification

This profile verifies against the DID document returned at verification time.
If the key identified by `kid` is no longer authorized by `assertionMethod`,
verification does not succeed. The Signature object's `issuedAt` value records a
claim by the issuer; it is not an independently trusted timestamp and cannot
prove that a removed key was authorized in the past.

Historical verification requires a trustworthy record of the DID document and
the relevant key authorization at the time of signing. This specification does
not define such a record. Applications that require durable historical
verification need an additional mechanism, such as a versioned DID method,
transparency log, or independently timestamped signature profile.

#### Verification Result

Signer authentication succeeds only when the Signature object and detached
JWS satisfy [Signature Object](#signature-object), the DID document resolves
and authorizes exactly one suitable ES256 key under `assertionMethod`, and
the signature verifies over the reconstructed payload. The authenticated
identity is the DID whose document and key authorization were checked, not
an unsigned display label or an unverified `kid` string.

Failure MUST NOT be treated as a verified endorsement. Consumers MAY retain
or display unverified content, retry temporarily unavailable resolution, or
reject it according to local policy. A successful signature is acceptable
as current only after [Signature Acceptance and Time](#signature-acceptance-and-time).

### The `did:web` Publisher Profile

This profile combines [The `did:web` Signer Profile](#the-did-web-signer-profile)
with [Entry Release Coverage](#entry-release-coverage). The entry MUST use the
standard `urn:air` syntax. Its `{publisher}` component is the text following
`urn:air:` and preceding the next colon and MUST satisfy the root `did:web`
domain restrictions above. The authenticated signer identity MUST exactly
match `did:web:` followed by that component. Subdomain, suffix, and
organizational-ownership heuristics MUST NOT be used.

For `urn:air:example.com:agent:billing`, the publisher signer is therefore
`did:web:example.com`. A valid signature by an assessor can endorse claims
about that same release, but does not satisfy publisher authorization.
Matching the publisher domain proves namespace control, not reputation,
claim accuracy, or artifact safety. Consumers choose which publishers and
claims meet their trust policies. A publisher signature need not select a
Trust Manifest when it only endorses the artifact release.

### Host and Catalog Authorization

Host and catalog signatures use the same construction with their respective
contexts. The `did:web` Signer Profile can authenticate their signers, but
this specification does not define a universal mapping from a signer to
host or catalog authority. A separate profile or configured policy MUST
identify authorized operators and required field coverage before a consumer
accepts a signature as a host or catalog endorsement. A signer-supplied
`host.identifier` alone is not a trust anchor. A Host Info signature does
not endorse the containing catalog snapshot.

HTTPS authenticates the serving domain for transport. A DID document's
service endpoint may describe a location, but is not by itself proof that
the retrieved catalog was signed or authorized by that identity.

### Publisher and Policy Metadata

A release signature does not automatically authenticate `publisher`,
`privacyPolicyUrl`, or `termsOfServiceUrl`. A signer MAY select those fields
in addition to required release coverage. Consumers MUST distinguish
publisher-authenticated metadata from metadata supplied or endorsed by
another entity. Policy URLs describe the policy governing the artifact;
an operator's own catalog policy is not a substitute for that policy.
This specification does not define a verification profile for a
`publisher-identity` attestation.

### Verifying Artifact Integrity

To verify the representation bound by an entry endorsement:

1. Authenticate the signer, verify the signature, check its time, and confirm
   [Entry Release Coverage](#entry-release-coverage) and the authorization
   required for the intended claim.
2. Retrieve bytes from `entry.url`, or use `entry.data`, observing
   [Safe Fetching](#safe-fetching).
3. Compute the digest of the retrieved bytes or the UTF-8 JCS-canonicalized
   `data` value using the algorithm named by `entry.digest`.
4. Compare with `entry.digest`. A mismatch MUST fail artifact verification.

An unsigned digest can detect a content mismatch but cannot authenticate the
source. The optional `provenance[].sourceDigest` identifies an upstream source
and MUST NOT be substituted for the digest of this entry's artifact.

### Verifying Attestations

For each attestation in the `attestations` array:

1. Fetch the attestation document from `uri`.
2. If `digest` is present, verify the fetched document matches the
   declared digest.
3. Validate the attestation per its `type` (e.g., verify a JWT
   signature, confirm a PDF certificate is current).

### Provenance Statements

A Provenance Link MAY reference a signed provenance statement via
`statementUri` and the key that signed it via `signatureRef`. The statement's
own format MUST define its signature algorithm, signer authorization,
key-selection rules, and verification procedure. The `did:web` Publisher
Profile for Entry Trust Manifests does not automatically apply to a provenance
statement, whose issuer may be a builder, transparency service, or other party.

To process such a statement:

1. Fetch the statement document from `statementUri`, observing
   [Safe Fetching](#safe-fetching).
2. Validate the statement and its signature according to the statement
   format's verification procedure and the consumer's trust policy.
   `signatureRef` can assist key discovery when that format defines how to use
   it, but the value is not a trust anchor by itself.
3. Confirm the statement's subject matches `entry.digest`. Treat an
   unverifiable statement as absent, not as a failure of the artifact itself.

# Organizing Catalogs

As catalogs grow, a flat list of entries becomes unwieldy. Because any
catalog entry can have a `type` of `application/ai-catalog+json`,
catalogs are naturally composable — an entry can reference or inline
another AI Catalog, creating a hierarchy of any depth.

## Nested Catalog Entries

A catalog entry whose `type` is `application/ai-catalog+json`
references (via `url`) or embeds (via `data`) another AI Catalog
document. This mechanism supports two complementary use cases:

**Organizational hierarchy.** An enterprise with thousands of artifacts
can partition its catalog into sub-catalogs by department, product line,
or region. Each sub-catalog is an independent AI Catalog document with
its own `host` and entries:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:finance",
      "displayName": "Finance Services",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme.com/catalogs/finance.json"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:ml",
      "displayName": "ML Models",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme.com/catalogs/ml.json"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:devops",
      "displayName": "DevOps Tools",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme.com/catalogs/devops.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-artifact packaging.** An entry with a `publisher` that contains
a nested catalog may be interpreted as a set of items that could be
acquired as a unit. For example, a finance plugin that ships an A2A
agent, an MCP server, and a dataset together:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:plugin:finance-suite",
  "displayName": "Finance Plugin",
  "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
  "url": "https://acme.com/plugins/finance-suite.json",
  "publisher": {
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
    "displayName": "Acme Financial Corp"
  }
}
```

The document at that URL would itself be an AI Catalog containing
the A2A agent, MCP server, and dataset entries.

A nested catalog entry is a regular catalog entry — it has an
`identifier`, may carry `trustManifests` and `signatures`, and may include a
`publisher`. An entry inside a nested catalog MAY reuse the same
`identifier` as an entry elsewhere; this indicates the same logical
artifact.

Clients processing nested catalogs SHOULD impose a maximum nesting
depth to prevent circular references. A depth limit of 4 is
RECOMMENDED. Implementations MAY support deeper nesting but SHOULD
document their limit.

# Extensions

The `extensions` property appears on the AI Catalog top-level object,
on Catalog Entry objects, and on Trust Manifest objects. It provides
a single, well-defined extension point for custom or vendor-specific
properties.

## Format and Key Naming

The `extensions` field is a JSON object (map). Each key in the object MUST
represent the extension type (namespace), and the corresponding value contains the extension data.

To avoid collisions between independent publishers, the keys MUST
be a valid URL or a reverse-DNS string:

- **Reverse-DNS prefix** for vendor-specific extensions:
  `com.example.confidenceScore`, `io.acme.deploymentRegion`.
- **URL prefix** for publicly accessible extension schemas:
  `https://cisco.com/extensions/security-scan`.

Consumers that do not recognize an extension key MUST ignore it without
throwing an error.

For example, a catalog entry with `extensions` representing metadata and a custom schema:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:treasury.gov:okf:fiscaldata",
      "type": "text/vnd.okf+markdown",
      "tags": ["finance", "treasury"],
      "extensions": {
        "https://ai-catalog.org/extensions/metadata": {
          "location": "US-West",
          "environment": "staging",
          "version-compatible": [">=1.0.0"]
        },
        "https://openknowledgeformat.org/ns#": {
          "@context": {
            "us-gaap": "https://xbrl.fasb.org/us-gaap/",
            "ifrs": "https://xbrl.ifrs.org/taxonomy/"
          },
          "type": "Financial Dataset",
          "taxonomy": "us-gaap",
          "conformsTo": ["us-gaap:Revenue", "ifrs:Revenue"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Official Extensions

While publishers are free to create custom extensions, this specification
defines a set of "Official" known types for commonly requested schemas:

1. **Metadata** (`https://ai-catalog.org/extensions/metadata`)
   - Used to store generic, schemaless key-value pairs.

As custom extensions become highly popular, the AI-Catalog TSC may promote
them to Official Known Types or core standard fields in future specification versions.

# Version Handling

The `specVersion` field identifies which version of this specification
a catalog conforms to. This section defines how producers and consumers
handle version differences.

## Version Format

The `specVersion` value is a "Major.Minor" string (e.g., "1.0",
"1.1", "2.0"). Major and minor components are non-negative integers.

## Compatibility Rules

Minor version increments (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1)
: The specification adds new OPTIONAL fields or features. Documents
  conforming to a higher minor version are backward-compatible with
  consumers that understand the same major version. Consumers MUST
  ignore unrecognized fields.

Major version increments (e.g., 1.x → 2.0)
: The specification introduces breaking changes (removed fields,
  changed semantics, new required fields). Consumers that do not
  support the major version SHOULD reject the document with an
  informative error rather than silently misinterpreting it.

## Consumer Behavior

Consumers SHOULD:

- Parse the `specVersion` field before processing the document.
- Accept documents whose major version matches their supported major
  version, regardless of minor version differences.
- Ignore unrecognized fields (forward compatibility within a major
  version).
- Reject documents whose major version is higher than the highest
  major version they support, with an informative error message.

## Producer Behavior

Producers MUST set `specVersion` to the version of this specification
they implement. Producers SHOULD NOT set `specVersion` to a version
higher than they actually conform to.

# Discovery

## Location Independence

An AI Catalog document MAY be served from any URL. It is identified
by its media type (`application/ai-catalog+json`) and its `specVersion`
field, not by its URL path. Catalogs are equally valid when hosted at
an arbitrary path, embedded in a registry response, packaged in an
archive, or distributed as a local file.

When served over HTTP, the document SHOULD be served with the media
type `application/ai-catalog+json`.

## Well-Known URI

To support automated discovery, hosts MAY serve an AI Catalog at the
following well-known URI [[RFC8615]]:

    /.well-known/ai-catalog.json

Clients performing domain-level discovery SHOULD attempt to retrieve
this well-known URL. If a valid AI Catalog document is returned, the
client SHOULD use the entries' `url` values to retrieve individual
artifacts. Trust metadata, when present, is carried inline on the
entries as Trust Manifests.

Use of the well-known URI is OPTIONAL. Hosts that publish catalogs at
other locations (e.g., as part of an API response or a package
registry) are fully conformant.

## Dynamic Discovery

Implementing protocols MAY support dynamic catalog generation through
their own mechanisms, such as providing different catalog content based
on a caller's identity or query parameters. Defining dynamic discovery
behavior is out of scope for this specification.

## Link Relation Discovery

Websites MAY advertise their AI Catalog by including an `ai-catalog`
link relation in HTTP responses or HTML documents. This enables AI
agents, crawlers, and other automated clients to discover the catalog
associated with any website without prior knowledge of its location.

**HTTP Link header.** A server MAY include a `Link` header [[RFC8288]]
in HTTP responses:

    Link: <https://example.com/catalog/ai.json>; rel="ai-catalog"

**HTML `<link>` element.** An HTML page MAY include a link element in
the document head:

```html
<link rel="ai-catalog" href="/catalog/ai.json"
      type="application/ai-catalog+json">
```

**Agent-driven discovery.** AI agents that interact with websites
(for example, agents following user instructions to "find tools on
this site" or browsing on behalf of a user) SHOULD check for the
`ai-catalog` link relation on the target website. The discovery
procedure is:

1. Fetch the target URL and inspect the HTTP response headers for
   a `Link` header with `rel="ai-catalog"`.
2. If no `Link` header is present and the response is an HTML
   document, parse the document for a `<link>` element with
   `rel="ai-catalog"`.
3. If neither is found, optionally fall back to the well-known URI
   `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` as described in
   [Well-Known URI](#well-known-uri).
4. Retrieve the discovered URL. If the response has a media type of
   `application/ai-catalog+json` and contains a valid `specVersion`
   field, treat it as the site's AI Catalog.

This mechanism allows any website to surface its AI tools, agents,
and services to visiting agents through a standard, machine-readable
pointer — without requiring changes to the site's visible content.

# Conformance Levels

This specification defines three conformance levels. Each level builds
on the previous one. Implementations MUST satisfy all requirements of
their declared level.

## Level 1: Minimal Catalog

A conformant Minimal Catalog is a JSON document with media type
`application/ai-catalog+json` that contains:

- `specVersion` — the specification version string
- `entries` — an array of Catalog Entry objects, each containing at
  minimum `identifier`, `type`, and exactly one of `url` or
  `data`

All other defined members are OPTIONAL. This level supports consumers that
only need a simple list of artifacts. Each value in `trustManifests`, when
present at any level, MUST satisfy [Manifest Validity](#manifest-validity).

## Level 2: Discoverable Catalog

In addition to Level 1 requirements, a Discoverable Catalog:

- Includes a `host` object identifying the catalog operator
- MAY be served at the well-known URI `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`
  to enable automated domain-level discovery

## Level 3: Trusted Catalog

In addition to Level 2 requirements, a Trusted Catalog:

- Includes an acceptable publisher-authorized release signature on each
  entry whose publisher authenticity is to be relied upon, using
  [The `did:web` Publisher Profile](#the-did-web-publisher-profile).
- Consumers MUST authenticate signers, verify signatures and endorsement
  times, enforce [Entry Release Coverage](#entry-release-coverage), and verify
  artifact content against `entry.digest` before relying on signed claims.
- Trust Manifests are OPTIONAL. When their claims are relied upon as a named
  contributor's assertions, an acceptable signature authenticated as that
  contributor MUST cover those claims and the same entry release. A third
  party's endorsement alone MUST NOT count as named-contributor authorship.
- Consumers MUST distinguish the initial interoperable `did:web` profiles
  from other profiles supported by private agreement. Future profiles can
  define additional interoperable authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- SHOULD provide catalog-level integrity through a content-addressed channel
  or a signature satisfying [Catalog Snapshot Coverage](#catalog-snapshot-coverage)
  and an applicable operator-authorization policy.
- MAY include signed publisher metadata, attestations, provenance, and
  extensions, according to consumer policy.

Conformance does not imply that every optional signature is acceptable or
that every claim is true. Unverified additional contributions do not by
themselves invalidate an independently verified publisher endorsement.

Implementations at any level are fully conformant with this
specification. Consumers MAY ignore fields defined at higher
conformance levels and SHOULD gracefully handle their absence.

# Security Considerations

## Trust Layers

This specification supports a progressive trust model. Each layer
builds on the previous one, adding confidence without requiring all
consumers to implement every layer. Consumers choose the level
appropriate to their threat model.

**Layer 0 — Transport Security**
: The catalog and artifacts are served over HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later).
  The consumer trusts the TLS certificate chain and DNS resolution.
  This prevents passive eavesdropping and casual tampering but does
  not protect against compromised hosting or DNS hijack.

**Layer 1 — Artifact Digest**
: `entry.digest` allows consumers to compare fetched or embedded content
  with the declared digest. Without an authenticated endorsement, an attacker
  controlling the catalog can substitute both the content and the digest.
  A provenance source digest describes another artifact and is not this check.

**Layer 2 — Selected-Field Signatures**
: An entry signature binds selected claims to the artifact identifier,
  version when present, media type, and digest. The consumer authenticates
  its signer, checks release coverage, verifies artifact integrity, and
  evaluates authority for the intended claim. Independent contributor
  manifests can coexist. A valid signature over one contribution does not
  authenticate another or establish completeness of the catalog.

**Layer 3 — Content-Addressed Distribution (OCI)**
: The catalog is distributed through an OCI registry where all content
  — entries, artifacts, and Trust Manifests — is addressed by
  cryptographic digest. The registry enforces integrity: substitution
  is impossible because any change produces a different digest.
  Cosign or Notation signatures on OCI manifests provide an additional
  layer of publisher authentication.

Consumers that rely on trust metadata for security decisions SHOULD
implement at least Layer 2 (signature verification). Consumers that
only implement Layer 0 or Layer 1 SHOULD treat Trust Manifest content
as advisory, not authoritative.

## Nested Catalog Depth and Circular References

Clients processing nested catalogs SHOULD enforce a maximum recursion
depth to prevent denial-of-service attacks via deeply nested or
circular catalog references. A maximum depth of 4 is RECOMMENDED.

Depth limits alone do not prevent circular references at shallow
depths (e.g., Catalog A → Catalog B → Catalog A). Clients SHOULD
track the set of catalog URLs visited during recursive resolution and
reject any catalog URL that has already been fetched in the current
traversal path.

## Catalog Poisoning

An attacker who can modify a catalog document (e.g., through a
compromised hosting account or DNS hijack) can redirect consumers to
malicious artifacts by changing `url` values or injecting new entries.

The trust layers described above provide progressive defense against
this threat:

- **Layer 0** relies on HTTPS certificate management to prevent
  unauthorized modification.
- **Layer 1** enables post-fetch integrity checks but does not prevent
  whole-entry substitution.
- **Layer 2** binds the signed Trust Manifest to the logical artifact release
  and its representation via selected entry coordinates and `digest`, preventing
  artifact substitution or relabeling under a valid signature.
- **Layer 3** makes modification structurally impossible through
  content-addressing.

## Trust Manifest Substitution

Because a Trust Manifest is a peer element of the catalog entry rather
than part of the artifact, an attacker who can write the catalog
document can attempt to substitute the artifact, the Trust Manifest, or
both. This specification defends against substitution with three
compounding mechanisms:

- **Release binding.** Every accepted artifact endorsement jointly covers
  entry identifier, type, digest, and version when present, plus the claims
  relied upon. Consumers check coverage as well as cryptography and bytes.
- **Signer and claim authority.** Identity keys are not proof. Publisher
  authorization requires the authenticated signer to match the publisher
  namespace; contributor attribution requires authentication as that
  contributor. An attacker's valid signature does not confer either role.
- **Catalog-level integrity.** Entry signatures do not prevent adding,
  removing, or reordering complete entries. Hosts SHOULD provide a signature
  satisfying [Catalog Snapshot Coverage](#catalog-snapshot-coverage), with
  operator authorization, or an authenticated content-addressed channel.

Signatures do not prove that a newer manifest, omitted contributor, or revoked
evidence does not exist. Consumers requiring freshness beyond acceptable
endorsement times need an appropriate update source and evidence policy.

## Identifier Typosquatting

Catalog entries are identified by URIs/URNs. An attacker can register
identifiers similar to legitimate ones (e.g., `urn:air:acme.com:agent:financ`
vs. `urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance`) to trick consumers into using a
malicious artifact.

Registries and consumers SHOULD implement similarity checks on
identifiers. Publishers SHOULD use identifiers anchored to domains
they control (e.g., DIDs or domain-scoped URNs).

## Stale Attestations

Attestation documents referenced in Trust Manifests have no built-in
expiry mechanism in this specification. A SOC2 report from a previous
year may no longer reflect current practices.

Consumers SHOULD:

- Check acceptable contributor endorsement times; unsigned entry `updatedAt`
  is only an advisory listing timestamp.
- Independently verify attestation documents are current when making
  trust decisions.
- Treat attestations as evidence, not guarantees — the attestation
  indicates a claim was made, not that it remains valid indefinitely.

Future versions of this specification MAY add `validFrom` and
`expiresAt` fields to the Attestation object.

## Embedded Content Safety

When the `data` field contains embedded artifact content, consumers
MUST treat it as untrusted input. In particular:

- Content with HTML or script-capable media types MUST be sandboxed
  and MUST NOT be executed in the consumer's security context.
- Consumers SHOULD validate that the `data` content is well-formed
  JSON (or the expected format for the declared `type`) before
  processing.

## Privacy Considerations

Logo URLs SHOULD use Data URIs [[RFC2397]] to avoid leaking client
information through image fetch requests. Publishers SHOULD carefully
consider what information is included in `extensions` fields.

# Example: Hierarchical Catalog

The following example shows how an enterprise uses nested catalog
entries to organize a large number of artifacts into browsable
categories. Each sub-catalog entry points to a separate AI Catalog
document:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:assistant",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/assistant.json",
      "description": "General-purpose corporate assistant agent."
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:finance",
      "displayName": "Finance Services",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme-corp.com/catalogs/finance.json",
      "description": "Financial agents, MCP servers, and datasets.",
      "tags": ["finance", "trading", "compliance"]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:engineering",
      "displayName": "Engineering Tools",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme-corp.com/catalogs/engineering.json",
      "description": "CI/CD agents, code review tools, and DevOps servers.",
      "tags": ["engineering", "devops", "ci-cd"]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:ml-models",
      "displayName": "ML Models",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme-corp.com/catalogs/ml-models.json",
      "description": "Model cards and inference endpoints.",
      "tags": ["ml", "models", "inference"]
    }
  ]
}
```

A catalog MAY contain both direct artifact entries and nested catalog
entries. In this example, the corporate assistant agent is listed
directly while department-specific artifacts are organized into child
catalogs.

# Example: Dual-Protocol Agent (MCP + A2A)

A single agent that supports both MCP and A2A protocols can be
represented as one catalog entry whose content is a nested catalog
containing both protocol-specific entries:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
  "displayName": "Acme Finance Agent",
  "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
  "description": "Finance agent accessible via both MCP and A2A protocols.",
  "tags": [
    "finance",
    "dual-protocol"
  ],
  "publisher": {
    "identifier": "did:web:acme.com",
    "displayName": "Acme Financial Corp"
  },
  "data": {
    "specVersion": "1.0",
    "entries": [
      {
        "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance:mcp",
        "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
        "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/mcp/server-card"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance:a2a",
        "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
        "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/finance"
      }
    ]
  },
  "trustManifests": {
    "did:web:acme.com": {
      "attestations": [
        {
          "type": "SOC2-Type2",
          "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
          "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The outer entry represents the logical agent as a single discoverable
artifact with its own trust metadata. The `data` field inlines a
catalog with protocol-specific entries, allowing clients to choose
MCP or A2A based on their capabilities.
